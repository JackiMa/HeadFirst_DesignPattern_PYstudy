    "# Chapter 2: Observer Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "In the world of software design, design patterns are solutions to common problems that occur in software design. These patterns are not ready-to-use code, but rather a description of how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. One such pattern is the Observer Pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observer Pattern\n",
    "The Observer Pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the **subject**, maintains a list of its dependents, called **observers**, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. This pattern is mainly used to implement distributed event handling systems, in a \"one-to-many\" relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose of this Chapter\n",
    "In this chapter, we will be implementing the Observer Pattern in Python. The goal is to create a \"Bulletin Board\" system. In this system, the Bulletin Board (subject) will hold the data and multiple Display Elements (observers) will display this data in different formats. Whenever the data on the Bulletin Board changes, all Display Elements will automatically update to reflect these changes. This is a practical application of the Observer Pattern, demonstrating how it can be used to maintain consistency across multiple display elements that are all dependent on the same data source."
