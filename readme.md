# Python Design Patterns: Learning with Headfirst Series

## Introduction

Welcome to my journey of learning design patterns using the **Headfirst Design Patterns** book. This repository contains my attempts to translate the book's Java examples into Python.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to facilitate my learning by implementing design patterns in Python. While the **Headfirst Design Patterns** book provides excellent explanations and Java code, I aim to understand these patterns better by rewriting them in Python.

## Structure

The repository is organized by chapters and design patterns as presented in the **Headfirst Design Patterns** book. Each pattern's folder includes:

- **Simple Example Code**: Basic Python implementations of the design patterns.
- **README.md**: Brief explanations and notes.

## Design Patterns Covered (Work in Progress)

- Strategy Pattern
- Observer Pattern
- Decorator Pattern
- Factory Pattern
- Singleton Pattern
- Command Pattern
- Adapter and Facade Patterns
- Template Method Pattern
- Iterator and Composite Patterns
- State Pattern
- Proxy Pattern
- Compound Patterns

## How to Use

## Note

This project is a work in progress and is not intended to be a comprehensive or production-ready library. It serves as a learning tool for myself and others interested in design patterns in Python.
